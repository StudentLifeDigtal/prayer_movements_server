h2.  How does PRYMV work?

# An individual creates a movement that represents a real world group.
# He invites others to follow that movement.
# He posts up prayer requests to the movement.
# Followers pray for various requests from the movements they are following.
# He posts up praise reports once the prayer has been answered.
